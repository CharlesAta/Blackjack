### The Rules are Simple
---
- The goal of the game is to get a cummulative sum of 21 in your hand.
- Avoid breaking 21 or it's a loss!
- The dealer is out to beat you, and so their goal is to have a number higher than yours while still remaining 21 or under.
- Face cards (ie. Jack, Queen, King), are worth 10.
- An Ace is worth 11 and/or 1, depending on the total sum in the player's hand.
- Both the player and the dealer start with two cards. One of the dealer's cards are hidden.
- Once the player has compeleted their move set, the dealer will decide whether to draw or stay and then flip their card(s).
- If the player breaks 21, the dealer wins.
- If the player's initial two cards equate to 21, it's blackjack and the bet earnings are doubled.
